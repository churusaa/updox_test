Ã¸The first challenge is to write an Ansible playbook that installs Filebeat, ElasticSearch & Kibana. 
Filebeat should be configured to index /var/log/syslog (or /var/log/messages). 
Include firewall rules, the ports exposed should be configurable with variables in Ansible. 
Polish it and treat it like it would be used in a production environment.

##Initial Setup

---

- name: Install + configure Filebeat, ElasticSearch, and Kibana
  user: updoxsvc
  sudo: True
  hosts: all
  tasks:

    - name: Install ElasticSearch
      apt: pkg=filebeat state=latest

    - name: Install Kibana
      apt: pkg=kibana state=latest

    - name: Install Filebeat
      apt: pkg=filebeat state=latest
      replace:
        ## Note: Change dest: to path: once Ansible 2.3 changeover confirmed
        dest: /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
        regexp: '..paths:[\n].+[\n]'
        replace: '  paths:\n    - /var/log/syslog\n'
        backup: Yes

    - service:
      name: filebeat
      state: restarted

    - ufw:
        open_ports=[80,443,4096]
        state: enabled
        rule: allow
        port: '{{ open_ports }}'
